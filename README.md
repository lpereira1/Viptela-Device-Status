# Viptela-Device-Status
Uses Vmanage APIs to verify device status using serial number.

Provides a flask powered website that allows you to enter a device serial number and get current status of tunnels and device information.

Useful if you dont want to give a party access to the vmanage but want them to be able to see the status (i.e: field engineers)
